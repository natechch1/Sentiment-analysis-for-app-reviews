        "For TextBlob sentiment analysis, polarity values range from -1 (most negative) to 1 (most positive). Sentiments with polarity values greater than 0 are usually considered positive, while those with values less than 0 are negative. Polarity values close to 0 are considered neutral.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "There are some difference between two sentiment analysis. There is a user review which is come from Birday said:\"fantastic app exactly say without bombarding advert like similar apps update latest birday update really hate widget look wrong doesnt blend like previous release need go find earlier release sorry really dont like change\". For this review, textblob gives score -0.06167 and Vader gives -0.8556. Textblob's score is more like neutral and vader's score is absolutely negative. In my thought, this user give a feedback which is this user do not like current version but this user is actually like this app because this user said app is \"fantastic\". I think this user is more like neutral which is same as textblob. Vader gives a negative score.  \n",
        "\n",
        "In some reviews, there is a huge difference.There is a user review which is come from Wechat said:\"app trash work okay first im trying login im unable saying server unavailable unable login network issue\". Textblob's score is -0.0625 and vader's score is 0.2263. Textblob's score is between negative and neutral and more like negative. Vader's score is between neutral and positive. I think this user is absolutely negative sentiment because this user said the app did a trash work. I think textblob gives a right score and vader gives a wrong score.  \n",
        "\n",
        "I think the difference between Textblob and Vader's scores is due to the different algorithms they analyze. Textblob gives each word in the text a score analyzing sentiment and calculates the overall sentiment polarity of the text based on the sum of these scores. Vader, on the other hand, uses more text-oriented grammar rules. It considers the grammatical and syntactic structure of sentences and assigns sentiment scores based on the strength of positive or negative words. In the case of the Birday review, Textblob's score is close to neutral because it seems to be a mixed sentiment review with both positive and negative comments. Vader's score, on the other hand, is strongly negative, which suggests that it has detected more negative sentiment in the review. In the case of the Wechat review, Textblob's score is slightly negative, which suggests that it has detected more negative sentiment in the review. Vader's score, on the other hand, is closer to neutral, which suggests that it has detected a more balanced sentiment in the review.  \n",
        "\n",
        "For review analysis of my apps, I think textblob is best option. For the analysis of comment sentiment, the user's sentiment in the comment will be relatively strong and obvious. I don't think this requires complex algorithms for syntax and grammar. TextBlob is an easy-to-use sentiment analysis tool and can quickly and comprehensively understand the sentiment of reviews. Textblob performance better than vader in my example.  \n",

        "In Assignment 1, I write the feature cluster for my SUD. However, there are most of feature cluster are simillar between the discord app and my SUD app. I could comparing based on that. For topic 1,3,9,11,14,18, they are all talking feature about text/voice message, reply, video and emoji. These feature is not appear in my SUD app's requirements because my SUD app is named Birday and it used to record the user's date. In discord reviews, reviewer highly recognize and praise because they give lots of positive words. For topic 6 and 23, they are the feature about platform and version control. These feature requirement can connect to my SUD app. In my SUD requirements, R8 and R9 is talk about version control. \"R8: The software shall provide each version’s history which contains updated feature. R9: The software should provide each version’s download choice under each version history.\"  For topic 12, it reference to user account and login. For topic 25, it also reference to user login and gave a negative topic because of invalid and wrong login. In my SUD app, I didn't write requirements about user login.  \n",

        "For this LDA model, the accuracy of LDA topic modeling models is affected by the size and quality of the data used for training. If there is too little data for the size of the data, it may not capture all themes or variations of the data and the resulting topic model may be less accurate. Of course, if the data is too large, there will also be negative effects, such as too long training time and huge data will overwhelm the model. There will be an optimal data size for training a model and the optimal data size depends on the complexity of the data and the specific problem to be solved. . Data quality has a big impact on the model. If the data used for training is noisy and incomplete, regardless of the data size, it will negatively affect the accuracy of the topic model. In the discord data I chose, first of all, it has sufficient data size (5000 reviews I think is a good data size). Second, the data quality is also good because I pre-processed the data in Task2.  \n",

Discord is a powerful communication platform designed to connect users with each other in an engaging and interactive way. User login serves as a vital feature in Discord, allowing users to easily create accounts, log in, and authenticate themselves in order to access the full range of platform functionalities. Once logged in, users can seamlessly navigate through their accounts, join servers, actively participate in chat rooms, and interact with other users. The chat feature lies at the heart of Discord, providing users with real-time messaging capabilities that enable text-based conversations, information sharing, and collaboration in groups. The chat feature also boasts convenient options such as message formatting, emoji support, message history, and notifications, ensuring effective and efficient communication within the Discord community. Discord's user login and chat functionalities are essential components that empower users to fully utilize the platform and foster meaningful connections with others.  \n",

For the suggestion 1, my SUD did not need this feature. For suggestion 2, my SUD app is really simple app and it does not require a large data transfer and has low requirements on network and mobile phone performance. All a SUD app needs is a simple and convenient user interface and flow. For the SUD app, my persona suggestion is to add more date options, not limited to the records and reminders of birthday dates, but dates such as wedding anniversaries should be added.\n"
